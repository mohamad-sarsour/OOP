## As you know Java (and C#) has decided on an alternative to multiple inheritance by using interfaces,In Java there is a restriction of inheritance from only one class, but it support for Implements any number of Interfaces,that how a class can commit to a contract with a large number of Interfaces and thus enrich its protocol to the outside.

## since Squeak does not support interfaces as part of the language, the above file will use Squeak's standard class,and will put on it the idea of an interface, therefore the above file in fact adds a version of Interfaces in Squeak.
